many\npeople are also requesting others to\njoin into some WhatsApp group I don't\nhave any WhatsApp group I have only one\nWhatsApp Community for my English\nChannel and one WhatsApp Community for\nmy marati Channel The Links of these\ncommunities are there in the description\nbox and both have a verified tick so\nplease don't fall pray to these frauders\nand spread the word as well hey folks SI\nRAR R here and I welcome you all to a\nvery very important video wherein we are\ngoing to discuss about a stock and why\nis it in news of late it is a stock\nwhich is favorite for so many investors\nand the name of the stock is ITC but not\nonly investors it is of course the\nfavorite stock of memers and there have\nbeen so many memes around this stock I\nhave read I'm sure at least more than\n150 memes about this but my personal\nfavorite is this one patience level\ninvest in\nITC I think the three scene has been\ngiven a totally different investor angle\nin this one but I think the stock\nactually asked people to shut their\nmouth when when it gave a\n75% return in a period of one year\nstarting March 22 to March 23 but this\nstock has been in news off late because\nof\nB she B is the name of the\ncompany this okay we are going to\ndiscuss about this in the next section\nof the video so let's understand about\nthe news of bat uh that is nothing but\nBritish American Tobacco okay now this\ncompany held almost 29% stake of ITC and\nthat was valued at 1.5 lakh CR and on\n13th March 2024 this company bat which\nis like one of the biggest shareholders\nof ITC they sold 3.5% stake in ITC\nlimited and they sold it in the Open\nMarket at a price of 400 r25 PESA around\n43 cr shares aggregating to 17,488\ncrores were sold in the open market okay\nnow first of all we need to understand\nthat whenever such a huge supply huge\nsupply means what almost 43 cr shares\nhow much do we buy 43 shares correct of\none company they have sold 43 cr shares\nokay if there is such a huge supply of\nany specific stock in the market what do\nyou feel basic economics Supply is more\ndemand is more or less similar in that\ncase ideally price should fall right but\nwhat happened instead on 13th instead of\nthat on 13th March in fact the price I\nmean the the stock showed a gap up\nopening and also it has closed almost\n4.45% higher as compared to the previous\nday okay now in spite of such a huge\nsupply why did this happen was the big\nquestion right so for that when I tried\nto understand what could be the reason\nwe found out that bat is one of the\nStrate IC investors or key investors\nmeans what do I mean by that see bat has\nbeen the investor in ITC since Inception\nalmost so they have been invested in ITC\nfor almost 100 years now okay so what do\nyou feel whatever shares bat had were\nthey freely available for trading answer\nis no they were not freely available for\ntrading they had it with themselves will\nthis be counted in the market\ncapitalization of ITC yes but will this\nbe counted in free float Market\ncapitalization of ITC answer is no this\npoint is clear very important Point\ntypically free float market\ncapitalization is nothing but total\nmarket capitalization minus whatever\nnumber of shares multiplied by its price\nobviously is not freely available for\ntrading what could be the examples\nwhatever stake promoter has held that is\nnot freely available for trading\nwhatever stake any strategic investor\nhas held that is not freely available\nfor trading shares which are locked in\nthey are not freely available for\ntrading these are some examples right so\nthey are not counted in the free float\nmarket capitalization when bat sold\nthese shares so now you can imagine what\nhappened free float of ITC in fact\nincreased simple toar now you might be\nlike why am I giving so much importance\nto free float market capitalization has\nincreased in case of ITC because ITC is\na part of nifty I be like to well\nnifty's calculation is not based on\nmarket capitalization it's based on free\nfloat market capitalization and that is\nthe reason why itc's weightage in Nifty\nwill increase to some extent if that be\nso index funds basically passive index\nfunds they are definitely going to buy\nITC so whatever is going to be the\nsupply that is going to be absorbed by\nthese index funds at least other than\nindex funds or specifically talking\nabout these fund houses who may buy do\nwe already know few fund houses who have\nalready bought the shares yes when uh\nyou know bat sold the shares almost 9.2\nCR shares of ITC were bought by GIC\nSingapore and almost 12.4 CR shares were\nbought by ICI Prudential both were I\nmean there were multiple block deals but\nthese two I thought were one of the\nbigger ones so that is why I thought of\ntelling this to you so I hope you have\nunderstood all in all now to just to sum\nof this entire news number one was there\na supply of shares yes would that be\notherwise considered as a bad news yes\nbut number three was this absorbed very\nnicely yes majorly by dis and FIS okay\nand number four because this led to an\nincrease in free float market\ncapitalization for ITC that was also\ntaken as a positive\nnews now the next question that pops up\nin our mind is why could have bat sold\ntheir stick okay now when I try to\nanalyze the chart of bad that's how it\nlooks like and if you see here the stock\nprice has gone back to 2010 levels right\nnow correct now ideally company needs to\nboost the investors confidence in such\ncases and one of the tool could be\nannouncing a buyback okay now if they\nwere to announce a buyback then\nobviously they need a lot of money and\nthis money could have been raised\nthrough what by selling the stake in ITC\njust to give you one point about this it\nwas mentioned in the news that bat plans\nto use the proceeds from ITC stake sale\nto buy back its own shares worth GBP 1.6\nbillion 1.6 billion rupees 1.6 billion\nGBP over a period ending December 25th\noh sorry December 2025 starting with GBP\n700 million in\n2024 so I hope you have understood that\nwhat could have been the reason why bat\nsold stake in ITC it is it has got\nnothing to do with the fundamentals of\nITC it is to fund a requirement which\nbat had now let's understand about one\nmore news which was so much discussed\nabout regarding ITC which was about the\nDem merger of its Hotel business this is\nthe news back which dates back to 23 but\nstill I think this is also important for\nus to quickly discuss about this it is\nexpected that the demerged business of\nhotel is expected to list on the stock\nexchange around November 2024 now you\nmight be like recently also we heard\nabout some deerg news that was about\ntataa Motors it was mentioned that the\nPV and EV is going to be separated from\nthe CVS from the commercial vehicles\nright now what happens when such\ndemergers happen number one investors\nwho believe in a specific theme they get\nan additional investment opportunity to\ninvest in a specific focused theme for\nexample if I'm talking about ITC and if\nI feel that ITC hotels is really you\nknow doing very well and because I want\nto own a part of ITC hotels I will have\nto buy ITC share but now if I'm giving a\nchoice that ITC Hotel Ka share you will\nget separately I would definitely want\nto invest only in that business so from\nan investor perspective I get an option\nokay from a company perspective what\nhappens is that because when they\ndemerge businesses they can focus better\non each and every single business if the\nfocus is clear the performance improves\nthe moment performance improves it shows\nup in the financials and in fact many\nexperts believe that after itc's Dem\nmerger the when the hotel business is\nset aside itc's roce that is return on\nCapital employed and also r i both are\nexpected to increase by almost 10% so I\nthink it's going to be a win-win for\neven investors as well as the company so\nI hope you have understood about this\nnews in short so in the section of the\nvideo which is the last section we are\ngoing to understand about the business\nmodel in absolute brief because I'm sure\neveryone knows what ITC does but we are\nalso going to understand the QQ and Yi\nperformance quickly based only on two\nparameters one is revenue and one is\nprofitability and number three very\nimportant we are going to talk or we are\ngoing to really analyze whether this\nstatement holds true what is the\nstatement the statement is that many\npeople believe that ITC is wanting to\nmove away from cigarettes business\nthey're moving away from cigarette to to\na non-cigarette business whether that is\nhappening we'll try and understand the\ntrend over the last 5 years so all these\nthree things we're going to cover in\nthis specific section so first let's\nquick quickly get started with five\nmajor business verticals the very first\none is cigarettes everyone knows that\nsecond one is fmcg as a business\nvertical and a moment I use uh examples\nlike sunfist Ashira dat Bingo classmate\neveryone is aware about these Brands\nright all belong to ITC and all are\nunder the same business verticle of fmcg\nright if I'm talking about hotels ITC\nHotel everyone knows a pretty famous\nfive star hotel chain and they also have\none more chain which is called as\nWelcome Hotel fourth one is agre\nbusiness and itc's agre business is the\ncountry's second largest exporter of\nagre products products like wheat wheat\nflour rice coffee all these are what are\nexported by this company and last one is\npaper boards paper and packaging this is\nnot a very big division of the company\nbut\nuh cardboard\ncardboard so that is what uh can be\nconsidered under this segment of\npaperboard paper and packaging okay so\njust quick uh brief details about what\ndoes the company do with this now let's\ngo on to the QQ and Yi performance so\nfirst have a look at this now if you see\nsegment Revenue only we are talking\nabout the revenue right now on a QQ\nbasis be it cigarettes be it others be\nit agree be all these three all are in\nnegative okay paperboard packaging is\nbarely in positive .5% biggest positive\nis hotel with 29.74\nperc growth QQ but I don't think this\nhas to be even considered why Q3 is\nalways better better as compared to Q2\nbecause hotels is a cyclical business in\nQ3 we'll have holidays like Diwali\nChristmas and that is that is when\ntypically people love to travel and\ntypically hotels business does see a\nsurge in this so not a very relevant\ndata for analysis per se let's\nunderstand about the profitability have\na look at this as far as PBT is\nconcerned be it again cigarettes others\nagre paperboard everywhere QQ there's a\ndegrowth I mean you can see negative\nnumbers right uh but hotels 82.5 4%\nagain you know the reason why seasonal Z\nright now let's understand the Yi\nperformance this is also important on a\nYi basis B it's almost posi if you see\ncigarettes 3.58% uh positive fmcg other\n7.6% hotels 18.2 26% good now this is YY\nseasonality is gone here right if you\nsee agre is just minus 2% downturn and\npaperboards packaging is almost 9.76%\ndown uh so there's only one area where\non a YY we see almost a 10% negative\ngrowth if I'm talking about PBT PBT\nyou'll see our cigarettes a shade higher\nwith 2.3% fmcg 24.14% growth Yi hotels\nfantastic 57. 53% growth Yi agre and\npaper board again both in negative with\n13.3% and 51.1 16% respectively so all\nin all if you ask me finances are not\nlooking like super duper hit average\nabove a is what I can see let's see how\nthe performance of the company is seen\npost Dem merger I would be really happy\nto see that as well but now let's try\nand focus on the point of whether they\nare really shifting from cigarette\nbusiness to non-cigarette business or\nnot and for that we'll have a look at a\nfiveyear snapshot so if you see here\nyou'll understand the first one is fmcg\ncigarettes right now how much is the\noverall Revenue if you see here back in\nQ3 fy20 the revenue was\n5,311 CR\nwhich was contributing to what\n41.411465\nyears their revenue contribution\ncigarettes Revenue contribution has has\ngone down barely by 1% 1 point something\nnow what I've done fmcg others hotels\nagre business and paper board I've taken\nthe summation as a non-cigarette\nbusiness now this has gone up from what\nto what from 58.5 % to 59.71 per. so\nover a period of 5 years again Revenue\nhas barely increased by 1% obviously it\nhas to be that right so I don't see that\nthey are moving from cigarettes to\nnon-cigarette in a big way the\ndifferentiator is barely 1% but also\nlet's have a look at the profitability\nnumbers profitability you will\ndefinitely see that from cigarette\nbusiness it has gone down from 83.5% to\n78.4 7% what profitability contribution\nof cigarette segment to the overall\nprofitability of the company that has\ngone down from 83.5 % to 78.4 7% and\nnon-cigarette has gone up from 16.5% to\n21.5 3% so shade better for\nprofitability perspective not that great\nfrom the revenue perspective ultimately\nlet's also talk about the profit margins\ngenerated by each business right now if\nyou see your cigarettes is again has\nbeen a consistent big chunk for ITC\nabove 6 60% throughout of course it has\nbeen slowly and steadily decreasing from\n70.7% to 62.6 % happy about hotels\nthough I'm not going to consider fy21\nand Q3 fy21 and Q3 fy22 reason being\nvery simple Corona but fy20 it was\n15.76% profit margin which has jumped up\nto 27.3 2% that is a very good jump I\nmust say and even fmcg others has jumped\nfrom 3.6 3.26% to\n8.29% I hope you have understood about\nthis fundamentals in a simple way well I\nhope you enjoyed today's video if you\nwant me to do the fundamental analysis\nof any other company please let me know\nin the comment section below but it has\nto be a fundamentally strong company\nthen only I would love to do the\nanalysis and share it with you all if\nyou did love this don't forget to smash\nthe like button don't forget to share\nthis video with your friends till then\ntake care sh\n[Music]\nbye-bye"
