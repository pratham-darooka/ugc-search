I don't have that much time or interest to spent that much time in these months. Because there are way too many that were on my list and I can't keep track of all the companies. \n\nCan you guys suggest some good stock which I don't have to bother for about a year which can give me at least 15% profit? And of course it'd be good if it's more than that\nAnd I can do little of my research on them as well. \n\nAnd Mutual Funds or Nifty 50, I never studied them much so if you guys are gonna suggest those. Then do let me know how much average profit they will give and how long I have to wait as well.\n\nAnd edit: some people mentioned there's never buy and forget. \nI do understand that. What I meant is I don't want to check on market few times every single day, I'll probably check twice a week or something like that", "post_comments": ["\nIf you haven't already, please add your own analysis/opinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a Low Effort post.\n\nPlease DO NOT ask for BUY/SELL advice without sharing your own opinions with reasons first.
