I will not go into very detailed tech views on this for mostly understanding of the common people here. The graph is pretty much not the correct representation as it is not a candle or trend graphs but pretty much does the work that I want to explain here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnalysis : \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Stock is consolidating at the same avg level for last 3 years now, to be specific from Feb 2023. It has not seen a rally at all even in this Bull market. This happened due to various reasons. Like merger, opening branches rapidly etc. The company is really investing in future with it's huge Cap. ( Refer to the price chart ) \n2. The company is way below it's median PE zone. For a company of this stature it is very rare in this bull market. \n3. Though their Net profit margin is kinda not growing due to merger recently and companies investing in opening newer branches every year, the revenue is at ATH. HDFC opens 650-700 branches each year which is same as maybe total no of branches for many fairly big banks. \n4. Company is sitting on huge revenue and net profit currently. The Cash in flow is also quite big in positive numbers. The financials look pretty strong. There are few issues of course like Contingent liabilities of Rs.18,22,393 Cr, Earnings include an other income of Rs.88,999 Cr which doesn't have a clear breakdown. \n5. FIIs are heavily invested in this stock. So Fed rate cuts in coming quarters is gonna be very very profitable for this stock hopefully. One thing here that the stock of this company can be manipulated by FIIs and DIIs heavily. \n6. The latest quarterly report is also not too bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuture : \n\n1. I am not literally sure about the target price but I am sure for long term holding it is quite a good Large Cap stock. \n2. It can fall further. I have mentioned the support levels. It has already fell below two levels, I personally took newer positions in both the levels. Next level is also only 3.5-4 % around away. But once it holds one of the levels, it will stabilize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the moral of the story is, HDFC are going through a lot of structural changes and strategy changes. The fundamentals are strong though. The stock is underbought, consolidation for long term. I am quite sure that this stock will rally in a long term. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know of your views. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "post_comments": ["\nIf you haven't already, please add your own analysis/opinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a Low Effort post.\n\nPlease DO NOT ask for BUY/SELL advice without sharing your own opinions with reasons first.

So USA cannot cut the fedrate as it increase in the inflation with supply being less from China. Hence FPIs are pulling out money as US bond markets are attractive investment.

ITC was sideways for the longest time till it took off.", "All this analysis is useless as in the end EPS is not growing. For future this type of talk looks fascinating but there is real pain in the banking sector as provisions are increasing, CASA deposits r not increasing.

Today it fell into red.\n\nFor long term I am super bullish about it(similar reason as you mentioned and their balance sheet).\n\nI am not going to look at it for atleast 5 years.\n\nI am expecting atleast 5 bagger on the very optimistic side and atleast double in worst scenario in that time frame.\n\nI will keep adding it in SIP mode.", "I've never owned it heavily, I'm owning 20 shares and it's just 0.5% of my folio, is it a good time to accumulate, like buy 3 or 4 daily for the next 30 days??", "Compare mcap and profits with reliance.

Mcap of Reliance is 1830895 crore and mcap of hdfc bank is 10,89698 crore Reliance profit for trailing twelve months is 79104 Cr, for hdfc bank it is 60,068 crores.
