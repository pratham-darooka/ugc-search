Some analysts are saying that it will grow as much as 525 in 1 or 2 months. Although after such a bullish run, there's high chances of it falling pretty hard. So what is the opinion of you guys? Do you see it rising even more?\n\nSlightly off topic, but I heard that the govt increased cigerette prices again. Yesterday I went to smoke and they charged me 18 rs for a Goldflake Lite, which was 17 just last week. So this may also affect the stock prices of the company.", "post_comments": ["Subscribe to our [weekly newsletter](https://pennyleaks.substack.com/) and join our [Discord group](https://discord.gg/8QF4dqPHuw)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It has a strong brand portfolio, distribution network, and cash flow generation. However, it also faces challenges such as high taxation on cigarettes, slow growth in non-cigarette segments, and regulatory uncertainties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the search results, ITC stocks are trading at an all-time high of around \u20b9468-472, with a P/E ratio of 30.66. Some analysts are bullish on the stock and expect it to reach \u20b9525 in one or two months, while others are bearish and expect it to fall to \u20b9400-410 levels. The stock has given a return of 60.82% in the last one year and 42.63% year-to-date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe recent increase in cigarette prices by the government may have a positive or negative impact on the stock price of ITC. On one hand, it may boost the revenue and margins of the company, as it has a dominant market share and pricing power in the cigarette segment. On the other hand, it may also affect the volume and demand of cigarettes, as consumers may switch to cheaper alternatives or quit smoking altogether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, if you want to buy ITC stocks now, you should do your own research and analysis and follow your trading plan. You should also consider the fundamentals, technicals, and valuations of the company and the industry. You should also be prepared for the volatility and risk involved in the stock market. #ITC #Stocks #Trading", "Buy during dips", "When I first started 10 years ago, Goldflake lights was Rs 6, chota Goldflake was Rs 5. Price has tripled in 10 years (comes to approx 11% annual rise, higher than inflation). \n\nI no longer smoke so I can't say anything about consumer sentiment but these prices still sound affordable. Only the middle class buy cigarettes, the poor have bidis. In some western countries they have raised the cigarette prices to absurd levels and that has resulted in many people quitting or reducing the amount of cigarettes they smoke. Maybe we will reach such a point in a few years and hopefully ITC will have better diversified by then.", "Overhyped nonsense lmao y'all didn't buy at 300 why now", "Cigarettes and alcohol are tax getters for the government, it\u2019s true that overall the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes are increasing with the hectic lifestyle- so I don\u2019t think demand is going to be a problem anytime on the future.  It since these are like \u2018sin\u2019 commodities, these would never get tax reductions and only going to get more taxed in the future, so no longer look at ITC from that point of view - the company is going to divest more from here , but every other sector of FMCG already has tough competition.
