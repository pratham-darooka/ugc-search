I had stayed away from the firm all these years because i didnt want to get into the cigarettes business. But i found that there was untapped value in ITC's FMCG, agri, IT and paperboard business. I was also aware that the hotel industry was keeping ITC's value below the intrinsic value. I finally decided that i would take a long position on this company when the share price was around 200 and PE just below 20.\n\nAt the time, analysts were split in their prospects for ITC with around 50% of them having a buy target at around 270-300 and remaining either had a hold or sell call.\n\nThen few years passed and now every analyst wants you to invest in ITC. The new target is around Rs 500-560. What changed in the last two years that didn't happen in the previous years? The stock price went up. Its easy to predict rains when its cloudy. What most analysts do is follow market trends. They dont have an independent view point on stocks which is why you should never take investment advise from anyone and make your own judgements based on numbers.", "post_comments": ["Subscribe to our [weekly newsletter](https://pennyleaks.substack.com/) and join our [Discord group](https://discord.gg/8QF4dqPHuw)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Atleast these sites use consistent and objective rules to come up with ratings rather than new thesis conjured out of thin air. I still remember brokerage houses introducing new valuation metrics to value loss making startups.", "I have seen such an example while I was investing a few years ago.\n\nAs a part of my portfolio, I had started investing in Welspun India many years ago when the price was around 90 (before that egyptian cotton quality fiasco). Then the price fell less than 50, but I hung on. I kept averaging it and it slowly inched towards 90 again. Then 2020 happend and the price went down to 30. I still kept averaging whenever I had surplua funds. In 2021 the price soared to 140. And that was when one day I saw analyst on TV discussing the good aspects of welspun india and how it can become a multibagger.\n\nCut to 2022 and the price again came down. I sold my holdings at 120 because I had to cover an obligation. I often think of people who bought at 140 after watching that analyst.", "Analyst reports have short term vision. They mostly look at QoQ results. Not much value should be given to them if one is long term fundamental investor. \n\nOr sometimes they have an ulterior motives.
