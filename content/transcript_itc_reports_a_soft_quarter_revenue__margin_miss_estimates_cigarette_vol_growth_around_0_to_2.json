    "transcript": "welcome back you're still tuned into\nPower breakfast and let's talk about the\nbig earnings which will be uh you know\nreally reacting today so we have ITC\nwhich actually missed both the revenue\nand margin estimate that the street was\nworking with so manglam is here with\nsome of the details uh manglam this was\na soft quarter but it was expected to be\nsoft right it was expected to be soft\nbut the numbers that were reported were\nweaker than what the street was\nanticipating this time around and why is\nthat because of muted performance taking\nplace in the cigarettes business there\nwas weakness in the agre and the paper\nbusiness which continued but importantly\nthe fmcg business continued to do well\nas did the hotels business the net\nprofit that was aided by a tax credit\nand higher other income as well so just\nto run you through the numbers Revenue\nwas close to 16,500 CR the street was\nworking with a number of 177,000 cror\nthe abitar came in at 6,000 CR a little\nover that the street was working with a\nnumber of 6,400 cres so both were a miss\nthe net profit like I said were aided by\nother income as well as a tax credit of\nnearly 500 odd cross itself what was\ngood in the numbers this time around it\nwas the fmcg business revenues grew at\naround 7 and a half% the ebit out there\ngrew by 24% marking the third straight\nquarter of 8.3% margins in the fmcg\nbusiness hotels we've been talking about\nhow that business is doing well so 18%\nRevenue growth 57% growth in the eitaa\nbut Agri as well as paper both of them\nsaw Revenue declines and a bigger\ndecline in the abbit for the paper\nbusiness now the cigarette volumes that\nactually declined or rather you know was\nflat to a decline of about 2% in that\nrange as against expectations of 0 to 2%\ngrowth and the reason why that happened\nis because one the base quarter had 15%\nvolume growth so you're going in with a\nstrong base secondly this is a vote on\naccount that we're seeing usually ahead\nof budget we see dealers stock up on\ncigarettes because they anticipate some\nsort of Duty change but because there's\na vote on account they're not doing that\nand the third part is that mass\nconsumption is struggling premium end is\ndoing a lot better and premium end does\nnot account as much for volumes as it\ndoes for Value so those are a couple of\nfactors for starters expect the stock to\nopen in the red today okay mangam thanks\na lot for laying out all of those uh you\nknow big highlights from the itc's but\nother ones"
