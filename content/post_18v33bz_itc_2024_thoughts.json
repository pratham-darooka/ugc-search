What you guys think will it rise at 2024? I know I'm too late at the party. I want to hold for long but if it doesn't rise much there is no point of holding for longer term. Some analyst saying it will rise to 500 mark, is it really gonna happen, what you guys think?", "post_comments": ["\nIf you haven't already, please add your own analysis/opinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a Low Effort post.\n\nPlease DO NOT ask for BUY/SELL advice without sharing your own opinions with reasons first.

I also look forward to it's dividend increasing to 15 rupees this year and 18 next year.", "Bhai phele decide krle kya krna h. In one sentence you say \"long term\", in another you say \"too late to the party\". How can be you late if you are looking for long term? Ek din me 1000% tordhi na milta h. Phele apna thesis clear rakho phir company dekho.\n\nAb mera gyan- ITC is a slow moving giant, with a very stable and in house name brands. Free cash flow bhayankar banati h due to cig and they use that money to venture into new businesses. Some stick some don't. Now from a share point of you- It essentially double every 6 year, which means a CAGR of around 14% with a healthy amount of yearly dividends. I believe in the FMCG brands that they are building (ashirvad, sunfeast) so I am comfortable with holding them for the next 7-10 year's if nothing drastically changes. Plus there is always the nicotine addiction which has proven resilient against all the government bans so that instills more faith for me.", "It will probably touch 500 this month only.
